- Attending and resident physicians interrupted every 9 & 14 minutes in ED.
- Medical error most likely due to combination of factors.
- Information transfers (handoffs) a recognized vulnerability for medical errors.

### Methods
- NYC, short-term qualitative study based on recorded observations.
- over 3 months, researcher/physician observed ED activities and recorded observations at representative times of day. Researchers were not responsible for patient care. 
- Semi-structured interviews also conducted 
    1. perception and internal representation of ED, patient care and physician roles
    2. nature of workflow and env. of care within specific ED

### Results
- Residents come up with diagnoses and treatments, but attendings responsible for final approval so minimizatino of cognitive load extremely important.
> "Facilitation of the process of multitasking may limit the
number of errors that occur. One method is to provide cognitive
support for a clinicians ‘internal schema through the
provision of an effective external representation of clinicians’
task and their subtasks. For example, the use of instant messengers
or electronic checklists tailored to the clinician may
decrease loss of information and enhance communication
amongst ED staff. Electronic tools must also be designed for
ease of use in a time-constrained environment to improve
efficiency of work practices."
- Wonder if this is true

## Holtzblatt, K., Wendell, J. B., Wood, S. (2005). Chapter 6: Work modeling. Rapid Contextual Design: A How-To Guide to Key Techniques for User-Centered Design.
- CD = Contextual Design
- Capture physical model for context during an interview.
- Also capture artifacts for artifact model.
- Work modeling begins during interpretation session.
- **Physical model** - representation of user's physical env.
- **Sequence model** - step by step recording of tasks observed during Contextual Interview.
- **Artifact model** - copies or representations of physical or electronic things the user creates, passes, or references to do a task.
- **Breakdowns** - something that gets in the way of the user accomplishing their task.
- **Trigger** - situtation that prompts a user to start a new task or step.
- **Intent** - the 'why' behind any user activity.


## Miles, R., & Hamilton, K. (2006). Chapter 3: Modeling system workflows: Activity diagrams. Learning UML 2.0. O'Reilly.

- **use cases** - show what system shoudl do.
- **activity diagrams** - specify how system will accomplish goals. Particularly good at modeling business processes. 
- **activity** - the process being modeled.
- **action** - a step in the overall activity.
- **guard conditions** - if/else evaluations from decision nodes.
