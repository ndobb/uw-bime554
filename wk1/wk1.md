## Preece, J., Rogers, Y., & Sharp, H.. (2002). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction

- In interactive design, investigate artifact's use and target domain by taking user-centered approach to development. Users' concerns direct development rather than technical concerns.

4 activites for interaction design:
1. identifying needs
2. developming alternative designs
3. building interactive versions
4. evaluation

3 key characteristics of interaction design process
1. a user focus
2. specific usability criteria 
3. iteration

### User focus
- imperative that representative users from the real target group be consulted.
- introducing something new into people's lives - especially new 'everyday' items - requires culture change in the target user popoulation.

### Alternative designs
- innovations arise through cross-fertilization of ideas from different applications, evolution of existing applications, or copying.
- decisions fall into 2 categories:
    1. externally visible and measureable features.
    2. internal to system that cannot be observed or measured without dissecting.

- **usability engineering**
    - specifying quantifiable measures of product performance
    - documenting them in a usability spec
    - assessing the product against them

**lifecycle model**
    - model that captures a set of activities and how they are related
    - incorporate a description of when and how to move from one activity to next
    - description of deliverables for each activity

- **rapid applications development**
    - takes a user-centered view to minimize risk caused by requirements changing
    - time-limited cycles of approximately six months (time-boxing)

## Berg, B., & Lune, Howard. (2012). Chapter 4: A dramaturgical look at interviewing. Qualitative research methods for the social sciences (Eighth ed.). Boston: Pearson

- researchers take on defined social roles in relation to informants.
- as an active interviewer, must consider meanings of information you are gathering from each question as you prepare the following question.
- all discussions of interviewing guided by some model or image of interview situation as "social performance".
- **Dramaturgy** involves elements of language and theater, stagecraft, stage mgmt.
- Drama is a mode of symbolic action in which some individuals act symbolically for others to watch symbolically.
- Interview Structure Continuum of Formality
    1. Standarized
    2. Semi-standardized
    3. Unstandardized
- 4 types of questions
    1. essential - concern central focus of study
    2. extra
    3. throwaway - demographic questions, used to develop rapport
    4. probing

- 10 commandments of interviewing
    1. never begin cold
    2. remember your purpose
    3. present a natural front
    4. demonstrate aware hearing

    8. be respectful

    10. be cordial and appreciative

## Community Tool Box. Chapter 3, Section 6. Conducting Focus Groups

- **focus group** is a small-group discussion guided by a trained leader. It is used to learn about opinions on a designated topic, and to guide future action.
- when to use a focus group
    - considering new program or service
    - want to ask questions not easily written on survey
    - want to supplement knowledge from surveys
    - when you know a skilled group leader
    - whejn you have time & resources to recruit a willing group
- invited people should be a *representative sample* for those whose opinions you're concerned
- need a recorder
- decide about incentives
- **conducting the group**
    1. thank for coming
    2. review purpose
    3. go over flow of meeting
    4. set the tone
    5. ask opening question
    6. make sure all opinions are heard
- share results with the group
