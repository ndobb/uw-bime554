## Preece, J., Rogers, Y., & Sharp, H.. (2002). Interaction Design: Beyond Human-Computer Interaction

- In interactive design, investigate artifact's use and target domain by taking user-centered approach to development. Users' concerns direct development rather than technical concerns.

4 activites for interaction design:
1. identifying needs
2. developming alternative designs
3. building interactive versions
4. evaluation

3 key characteristics of interaction design process
1. a user focus
2. specific usability criteria 
3. iteration

### User focus
- imperative that representative users from the real target group be consulted.
- introducing something new into people's lives - especially new 'everyday' items - requires culture change in the target user popoulation.

### Alternative designs
- innovations arise through cross-fertilization of ideas from different applications, evolution of existing applications, or copying.
- decisions fall into 2 categories:
    1. externally visible and measureable features.
    2. internal to system that cannot be observed or measured without dissecting.

- **usability engineering**
    - specifying quantifiable measures of product performance
    - documenting them in a usability spec
    - assessing the product against them

**lifecycle model**
    - model that captures a set of activities and how they are related
    - incorporate a description of when and how to move from one activity to next
    - description of deliverables for each activity

- **rapid applications development**
    - takes a user-centered view to minimize risk caused by requirements changing
    - time-limited cycles of approximately six months (time-boxing)
